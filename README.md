Hi there! Welcome to Rate My History!

To get the website running you will want
to download the files and have the list at
the bottom installed. After that, import the
sql file into your postgresql. Once the setup
is complete start the server.py file found in
the project folder and your website should
be running.

Make sure to have the following installed:
- Flask
- Python 2.0
- python-psycopg2
- postgresql
- postgresql-contrib

Have fun!
